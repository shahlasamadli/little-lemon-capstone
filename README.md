In the first module, starting the project, you'll do exactly that. Get started with the capstone project. This will include a brief recap of and links to content in the React course you have already completed, you'll start by setting up a coding environment, a React project, and a Git repository for the project on GitHub so you are ready to proceed with the development phase of the project.
